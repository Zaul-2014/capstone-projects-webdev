  <p class="about-txt">Programming is the art of telling computers what to do. At its core, it's about solving problems using logic and creativity. Beginners often start with HTML, the language that structures web pages. HTML is like the skeleton of a website. It defines headings, paragraphs, images, and links. CSS comes next, adding style and personality. With CSS, you control colors, spacing, fonts, and layout, making your site visually appealing.
  JavaScript brings interactivity. It lets you respond to user actions, like clicking buttons or submitting forms. For example, you can write a script that changes the background color when a button is clicked. As you learn, you'll encounter bugs â€” but debugging is part of the process. Each error teaches you something new.
  The key is consistency. Practice daily, build small projects, and don't be afraid to break </p>
