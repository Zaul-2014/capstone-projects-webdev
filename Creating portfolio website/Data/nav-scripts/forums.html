      <h2>Programming News Spotlight â€“ October 2025</h2>
      <p>
        The programming world is buzzing with innovation this month, as
        breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, developer tooling, and
        accessibility continue to reshape how we build and interact with
        technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most talked-about developments comes from Stanford
        University, where researchers have unveiled a groundbreaking wireless
        eye implant known as the <strong>PRIMA chip</strong>. This device,
        paired with smart glasses that emit infrared light, is designed to help
        individuals with macular degeneration regain the ability to read.
      </p>

        Meanwhile, <strong>Anthropic</strong> has released
        <strong>Claude Sonnet 4.5</strong>, a large language model that can
        autonomously write and debug code for up to 30 hours. This marks a leap
        in AI-assisted development, with Claude handling entire feature builds
        and documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Visual Studio Code 1.104</strong> now supports automatic AI
        model switching, integrating GPT-5, Claude, and Gemini Pro 2.5 for
        smarter coding experiences. And <strong>GitKraken</strong> has launched
        <em>Insights</em>, a feature that helps teams measure the productivity
        impact of AI tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        These stories reflect a broader trend: programming is evolving into a
        collaboration between humans and machines, building tools that are
        inclusive, intelligent, and adaptable.
